title: "Introduction to Statistics and R for Neuroscience"
The impact of statistics on human neuroscience can be discussed through the three main concepts of statistics defined by Ronald Fisher, father of modern statistics:
Predictive modeling offers exciting opportunities in neuroscience, enabling applications such as brain disease diagnosis and decoding mental states. However, it also brings challenges, especially with causal inference. Causal inference involves determining whether an observed relationship between two variables reflects a true cause-and-effect relationship. For example, irregular neural signals in a specific brain region may correlate with a mental disorder, but this association does not necessarily imply causation. These signals could be an effect of the disorder, or the relationship could arise from a coincidental correlation caused by unmeasured factors. This challenge is further exacerbated in high-dimensional brain data, where spurious correlations or incidental endogeneity—features unintentionally correlated with the model’s error terms—can violate critical assumptions and mislead conclusions.
